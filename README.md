## Supported devices

This currently supports the following devices:

- Apex Pro
- Apex 5
- Apex 7 (untested)

Other devices may be compatible and all that is needed is to add the ID to apex-hardware/src/usb.rs.

## Installation

For installing this software, follow these steps:

### UDev

1. Get the device id: `lsusb | grep "SteelSeries Apex"`:

```shell
$ lsusb | grep "SteelSeries Apex"
Bus 001 Device 002: ID 1038:1610 SteelSeries ApS SteelSeries Apex Pro
```

The **id** is the right part of the ID.

2. Enter the following data from [here](https://gist.github.com/ToadKing/d26f8f046a3b707e9e4b9821be5c9efc) (Shoutout [to @ToadKing](https://github.com/ToadKing)).

If those don't work and lead to an "Access denied" error please try the following rules and save the rules as `97-steelseries.rules`:

```shell
cat /etc/udev/rules.d/97-steelseries.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="input", GROUP="input", MODE="0666"

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1038", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<PRODUCT ID HERE>", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1038", ATTRS{idProduct}=="<PRODUCT ID HERE>", MODE="0666", GROUP="plugdev"
```

1. Replace the `ATTRS{idProduct}==` value with the device **id**.

2. Save all files to `/etc/udev/rules.d/97-steelseries.rules`.

3. Finally, reload the `udev` rules: `sudo udevadm control --reload && sudo udevadm trigger`

### Rust

- Install Rust **nightly** using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- Install required dependencies
  - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt install libssl-dev dbus-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev`
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:not-jan/apex-tux.git`
- Change the directory into the repository: `cd apex-tux`
- Compile the app using the features you want
  - If you **don't** run DBus you have to disable the dbus feature: `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features crypto,usb`
  - Otherwise just run `cargo build --release --features sysinfo,hotkeys,image`
  - If you **don't** have an Apex device around at the moment or want to develop more easily you can enable the simulator: `cargo build --release --no-default-features --features crypto,clock,dbus-support,simulator`

## Configuration

The default configuration is in `settings.toml`.
This repository ships with a default configuration that covers most parts and contains documentation for the important keys.

You can also run the software to find errors on configuration and to decide what is the right setup you need:

```shell

23:43:05 [INFO] Trying to connect to DBUS with player preference: Some("spotify")
23:43:05 [INFO] Connected to music player: "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.spotify"
```

In our case we need to set a right value for the sensor(`acpitz temp1`, critical temperatured one, i.e., cpu) and the network interface(`wlp3s0`, wifi) in the `[sysinfo]` section.

You can set your default media player on the `[mpris2]` section.


## Usage

Simply run the binary under `target/release/apex-tux` and make sure the settings.toml is in your current directory.
The output should look something like this:

```shell
23:18:14 [INFO] Registering Coindesk display source.
23:18:14 [INFO] Registering Clock display source.
23:18:14 [INFO] Registering MPRIS2 display source.
23:18:14 [INFO] Registering DBUS notification source.
23:18:14 [INFO] Found 3 registered providers
23:18:14 [INFO] Trying to connect to DBUS with player preference: Some("Lollypop")
23:18:18 [INFO] Trying to connect to DBUS with player preference: Some("Lollypop")
23:18:18 [INFO] Connected to music player: "org.mpris.MediaPlayer2.Lollypop"
23:34:01 [INFO] Ctrl + C received, shutting down!
23:34:01 [INFO] unregister hotkey ALT+SHIFT+A
23:34:01 [INFO] unregister hotkey ALT+SHIFT+D
```

You may change sources by pressing **Alt+Shift+A** or **Alt+Shift+D** (This might not work on Wayland). The simulator uses the arrow keys.

## Autostarting

To start on boot the binary must be started under an interactive daemon, i.e. by your Desktop Environment. A systemd service will fail unless compiled without hotkey support. Most DEs support the following method/path but you may have to find your equivalent.

-Create `apex-tux.desktop` in `~/.config/autostart`  
-Edit `apex-tux.desktop` to contain:
```shell
[Desktop Entry]
Exec=/path/to/apex-tux/apex-tux
Name=apex-tux
Path=/path/to/apex-tux
Terminal=true
Type=Application
```

## Development

If you have a feature to add or a bug to fix please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## TODO

- Windows support
- Test this on more than one Desktop Environment on X11
- More providers
  - Games?
  - GIFs?
- Change the USB crate to something async instead
- Add documentation on how to add custom providers
- Switch from GATs to async traits once there here
- Add support for more notifications
- Package this up for Debian/Arch/Flatpak etc.

## Windows support ETA, when?

I've written a stub for SteelSeries Engine support on Windows, there is an [API for mediaplayer metadata](https://microsoft.github.io/windows-docs-rs/doc/windows/Media/Control/struct.GlobalSystemMediaTransportControlsSessionManager.html) but my time is kind of limited and I don't run Windows all that often.
It will happen eventually but it's not a priority.

## Why nightly Rust?

Way too many cool features to pass up on :D
